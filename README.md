# myweb

This is a web which can only run on the local machine

This is V0 (can at least run, regardless of the beauty)

We support a dataest banknote.csv

We use xgboost, and calculate the shap values

We can use 3 methods (pca,umap,t-sne) to reduce the dimension of the data/shapvalues and visualise them

Then we can use Skope-rules to obtain a rule(top rule) of a segment of points chosen,
we can choose the segment by hand, or by kmeans, dbscan



Front-end	D3.js

Back-end	Flask

Python3




Just type "python myweb.py" in the terminal to run the web
